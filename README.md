# Mass Page Creator

Mpc is designed for use directly in your website. On average you can build 30,000 Html pages in less than 3 minutes. No FTP of files required. Pages are instantly live.

Other programs expect you to deal with complicated spreadsheets and hundreds of variables. And after all that work, pages are built with unpredictable Urls. Each run is different.

All that madness ends with Mass Page Creator::
No Spreadsheets. Not even one.
Only Nine Variables. Yes, that's all you should ever need. Variables are set by Mpc formulas, not spreadsheet entries.
Projects build predictable Urls. You can create 1000's of pages and rerun the Project to update all the pages. You can even UnBuild the Project to remove all the pages in seconds.
Mpc includes a Wordpress publishing plugin. So, you can use the power of Mpc for small Wordpress projects. For large projects, Mpc can "grab" one of your WP pages and use it for mass producing tens of thousands of Html pages. These pages will be themed exactly like your core WP site. No more bloated WP databases.
